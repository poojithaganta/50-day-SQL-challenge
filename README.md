# 50 Days SQL Challenge by Poojitha Ganta

Welcome to my GitHub repository dedicated to the **50 Days SQL Challenge**! My name is **Poojitha Ganta**, and I am currently pursuing my Master's in Data Science. This repository is a part of my journey to master SQL, and I am excited to share my progress and insights with you.

## About the Challenge

The **50 Days SQL Challenge** is designed to help me (and anyone following along) build a solid foundation in SQL through daily exercises and projects. Each day, I will tackle a new SQL problem or concept, ranging from basic queries to advanced database management techniques.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **Day 1 - Day 50**: Each folder contains the challenge for the day, including:
  - A README file with the problem description and objectives.
  - SQL scripts with my solutions.
  - Any additional resources or references used.
  
- **Resources**: A collection of useful SQL resources, including tutorials, articles, and reference guides.

- **Projects**: Larger SQL projects that apply the concepts learned during the challenge.

## Goals

- To enhance my SQL skills and understanding of database management.
- To provide a structured learning path for anyone interested in improving their SQL knowledge.
- To document my progress and share insights with the data science community.

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Clone the Repository**:
